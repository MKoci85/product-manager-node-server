# ðŸ›’ **Product Manager - CS50 Final Project**

## Overview

The **Product Manager** is a full-stack web application designed to manage product inventories efficiently. It allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on products, ensuring that businesses can keep track of their items with ease. Each product includes attributes such as **name**, **price**, and **availability**, providing key information needed to manage an inventory.

This project is submitted as part of the final requirement for the **CS50: Introduction to Computer Science** course offered by Harvard University.

## Purpose and Functionality

The purpose of this application is to simulate a real-world product management system. Users can perform the following actions:

- **Create**: Add new products to the inventory.
- **Read**: View a list of all products, along with their details.
- **Update**: Modify product attributes like name, price or availability.
- **Delete**: Remove products that are no longer needed.

The application has been designed to provide a seamless user experience with a **responsive user interface** and a well-structured backend API. It integrates modern web technologies to ensure performance and scalability, while adhering to the best practices of software engineering.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Table**: Displays a list of products.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that all required fields are filled in with valid data before allowing the user to submit any form.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages if something goes wrong, such as invalid inputs or issues with the server.
- **API Documentation**: Automatically generated API documentation using **Swagger** to assist developers in integrating with the backend services.

## Learning Objectives

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice and consolidate skills in:

- **Frontend Development**: Using **React.js** to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, with **React Router** to manage routes and navigation.
- **Backend Development**: Building a robust **RESTful API** with **Node.js** and **Express**, managing data securely and efficiently.
- **Database Management**: Storing and retrieving data from a **PostgreSQL** database using the **Sequelize ORM**, which simplifies the interaction with the database while enforcing data integrity.
- **Validation**: Ensuring that data integrity is maintained using the **Valibot** validation library.
- **Project Documentation**: Creating detailed API documentation with **Swagger**, which makes the backend services easily understandable and consumable by other developers.

## Conclusion

The **Product Manager** is a fully functioning web application that integrates both the frontend and backend components of web development. It showcases the practical use of databases, API design, and user interfaces, as well as the ability to develop and document a complete system from scratch. This project not only meets the requirements of the **CS50 final project** but also serves as a solid foundation for further exploration into the world of software development.
